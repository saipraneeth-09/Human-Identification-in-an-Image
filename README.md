# Human-Identification-in-an-Image
This project implements a real-time smart object and human detection system using a webcam. It uses the YOLOv8 model (pre-trained on the COCO dataset) combined with motion detection to optimize detection and computation.

Features
*Detects humans and 80+ common objects.
*Runs detection only when live motion/change occurs.
*Displays bounding boxes and object names with confidence scores.
*Reduces unnecessary computation by avoiding continuous detection.
*Easy to install and simple to use.

Technologies Used
*Python
*OpenCV
*YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
*Pre-trained COCO dataset

Objects It Can Detect
The system can detect objects from the COCO dataset like:
*Person
*Car, Bicycle, Truck
*Dog, Cat, Bird
*Bottle, Cup, Chair, TV, Laptop and many more!
